## Things we need to install
`brew install watchman`

## What does this APP do?

- provides an authenticated frontend to a nodejs server that will create authentication tokens for a user on:
- - signin (retrieving an existing account)
- - signup (creating a single use token for immediate login)
- then just to prove everything works as expected the user has access to a protected route for listing some sort of campaigns. It's nothing fancy.
